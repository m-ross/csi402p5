The arguments the "maina.c" part requires are an absolute or relative path to a directory and following that, an optional flag of "-s". The program prints to stdout the name, size in bytes, and date modified of each file in the directory. The output is sorted by increasing order of date modified if the flag is specified.

The arguments the "mainb.c" part requires are one flag from among "-c", "-x", and "-p". If "-c" is specified, the next argument must be the filename of an unformatted archive file to be created; following that, up to 255 filenames may be supplied which refer to files that will be added to the archive. If "-x" is specified, the only other argument must be the filename of an existing unformatted archive file to be read from; the program will extract each file contained in the archive file. If "-p" is specified, the next argument must be a string to search for in the filenames, and the next argument after that must be the filename of an existing unformatted archive file to be read from; the program will print to stdout the name and size of each file whose name starts with the specified string.
